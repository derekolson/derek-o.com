		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a creative technologist and software developer who is driven by unique and challenging problems. A nimble coder, I strive for simple, elegant solutions. I aim to fuse art and design with electronics, code, sensors, wires, and solder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the last six years, I have been recruited to produce work for outstanding digital shops around Chicago. I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.mediamath.com">MediaMath</a>, building out a suite of open-source web components to expedite the creation of user interfaces. In my downtime, I aspire to create magic by joining forces with kick-ass artists, designers and developers throughout the midwest. I am always seeking new challenges and collaborations.
