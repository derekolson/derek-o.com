		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a software designer and developer who is fueled by unique and challenging 
			problems. I aim to fuse art and design with electronics, code, sensors, wires, 
			and solder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the last twelve years, I have been recruited to produce work for outstanding 
			digital shops around Chicago. I currently work as a software design lead at 
			<a href="https://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, helping to dream up and prototype new 
			products and experiences for companies around the world. 
			In my downtime, I aspire to create magic by joining forces with amazing artists, 
			designers, and developers throughout the country.
			I am always seeking new challenges and collaborations.
		</p>
