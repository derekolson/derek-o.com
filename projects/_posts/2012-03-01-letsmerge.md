A live twitter feed, keynote announcer, and interactive sound visualizer all rolled into one. This project was created for "Let's Merge", a social mixer for those in the creative field throughout Chicago. Its custom particle systems and feeds were built in [Processing](https://processing.org) and had the ability to be controlled remotely over OSC.
