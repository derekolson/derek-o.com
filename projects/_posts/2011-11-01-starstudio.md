  Star Studio is an interactive photobooth concept that initially launched at shopping malls throughout California. We faced enormous challenges in integrating all the various systems, including a DSLR camera, photo printers, payment systems, digital signage, effect lighting, and two multi-touch photo editing stations. Built on Adobe AIR and PixelBender, I was tasked with building and integrating the editing stations, as well as developing the final chroma key / green screen implementation.
