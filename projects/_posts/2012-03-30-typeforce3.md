"Turned On" is an interactive neon sculpture that I collaborated on which was featured in Typeforce 3, an annual typographic art show in Chicago. It utilizes an Arduino with ultra-sonic distance sensors and custom fabricated servos to mechanically control a dimmer module. As you approach the piece it glows brighter and emits delightful mechanical sounds. More on this project [here.](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Typeforce-3/4103811)
