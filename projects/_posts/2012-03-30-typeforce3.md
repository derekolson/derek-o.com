 "Turned On", a collaborative project, is an interactive neon sculpture that was featured in Typeforce 3 - an annual typographic art show in Chicago. It is powered by an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc), ultra-sonic distance sensors, and custom fabricated servos that control a neon dimmer module. As you approach the piece it glows brighter while emitting satisfying mechanical sounds. More on this project [here.](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Typeforce-3/4103811)
