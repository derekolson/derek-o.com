  "Turned On", a collaborative project, is an interactive neon sculpture that was featured in Typeforce 3 - an annual typographic art show in Chicago. It is powered by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, ultra-sonic distance sensors, and custom fabricated servos that control a neon dimmer module. As you approach the piece it glows brighter while emitting satisfying mechanical sounds. <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/Typeforce-3/4103811">More info â†’</a>
